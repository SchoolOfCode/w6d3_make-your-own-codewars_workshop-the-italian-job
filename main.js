/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

- Decode the message 
- You are given a string of words containing an encrypted secret message. Your task is to decode the message.
- To decode the message, you'll have to work out the key the message was encoded with. 

-  This is a not so simple Substitution cipher task. Each letter of the string is swapped with another letter depending on the key.
- The key depends on the length of the sentence

- If the length of the sentence is between 0 and 10, the key is 5;
- if the length of the sentence is between 11 and 20, the key is 10;
- if between 21 and 30, the key is 15;
- if between 31 and 40, the key is 20; 

- the key tells you by how many places you should shift that letter, for example:
    with key 5, A becomes F (position 1 becomes 6);
    with key 10, B becomes L (position 2 becomes 12);
    with key 15, O becomes D (position 15 becomes 4);
        - if you reach the end of the alphabet, start from position 1 again 

- Do not alter spaces or any character outside of A-Z
- Input will be always be lowercase, so you don't have to worry about that. 

- if str.length is > than 40, return "String is too long for encoding"
